                            <p>Nowadays most professional team sports use GPS trackers on every player for training sessions and matches. These GPS devices produce an extensive/large amount of data that allow for a detailed performance analysis when properly used.</p>

                            <p>The use of this technology has changed most team disciplines and made them more fast paced and dynamic, changing the focus of the game strategy and even the business that surrounds sports. </p>
                              
                            <p>We wanted to take this analysis a step further and try to create a predictive model based on this information and see if it was possible to foresee, predict and eventually prevent player injuries. 
                              To do so we took as a test case a local professional rugby team who use GPS devices to track their performances. We focused on one specific tournament they recently played which consisted of twelve matches. All the information we used for the project is real, the players and teams, variables and injuries are real, but we changed the names of players and teams for confidentiality reasons.
                              We decided to work collectively as a group, having the three of us equally participate in the construction of it all, focusing on communication and learning from each other’s technical strengths.</p>
                              
                              <p>Ultimately, PlayerTrack was born.</p>
